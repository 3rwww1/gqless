This guide will help you create a `gqless` client for a GraphQL endpoint.

## Installation

> Important: If using Typescript, ensure version is 3.7.0+

Install the following dependencies to your project:

```bash
yarn add gqless
yarn add @gqless/cli -D

# or
npm install gqless
npm install @gqless/cli --save-dev
```

## Codegen

`gqless` requires information about your schema, which is generated using the CLI.

Add the following to your package.json, replacing `ENDPOINT_URL`:

```json
// if you're NOT using Typescript, then add --js
// see `gqless generate --help` for more
"scripts": {
  "generate": "gqless generate -u ENDPOINT_URL ./src/gqless"
}
```

And then run the script to generate your schema:

```bash
yarn generate
# or
npm run generate
```

A folder will then be created with the following structure:

```bash
src/gqless
├── extensions # All your extensions go in this folder
├── generated # Ignore this folder
├── client.ts # gqless client is exported from here
└── index.ts
```

## Usage

Make sure the endpoint in `client.ts` is correct, and you should be able to use the client

```ts
import { query } from './gqless'

// eg.
query.me.name
```
